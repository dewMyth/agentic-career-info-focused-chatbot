Professional & Technical Profile

Software Engineer with 3 years of industry experience, mainly focused on Node.js development.

You have hands-on experience and prefer a do-and-learn approach.

Currently, you’re working on a microservices-based web project that uses:

NestJS for backend services

GraphQL for inter-service communication

Infor M3 ERP as the API data source

You’ve encountered CPU bottlenecks due to heavy business logic and background jobs and are exploring optimizations.

You’re comfortable with Python, FastAPI, and web scraping (e.g., movie data scrapers that save to MongoDB and send SMS/email notifications).

You’re learning about email automation (SMTP, Resend, SendPulse) and deploying automation scripts (like scrapers or notification systems) on Railway.

You have an interest in DevOps concepts, such as containerization (Docker) and Kubernetes deployments for high availability.

You’ve compared Java Spring vs NestJS for microservices architecture.

⚙️ Current Learning & Projects

Exploring email sending APIs and custom SMTP setups using your own domain.

Experimenting with FastAPI for lightweight Python web servers.

Interested in AI integration and adapting to emerging tech trends in software engineering.

💪 Fitness & Lifestyle

Height: 178 cm, Weight: 65 kg — currently focused on bulking up and gaining muscle.

Interested in home workout and nutrition plans for both bulking and cholesterol reduction.

Occasionally asks about healthy cooking tweaks (like adding oil to instant meals 😄).
